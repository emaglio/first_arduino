# First Arduino

_"Playnig with electronic and C++ has never been more fun"_

First Arduino project using Iduino UNO, parts used:
- LM35 temperature sensor
- Photosensitive resistor
- 50k Adjustable resistor
- RGB Led Module
- LCD display
- Iduino UNO

##Get Arduino starting kit
First important step is getting a good starting kit where you can find the basic parts. I got [this](http://www.auselectronicsdirect.com.au/arduino-uno-ultimate-starter-kit) which has a good set of parts with Iduino UNO. It doesn't come with a manual but it's possible to follow [this one](https://www.auselectronicsdirect.com.au/assets/files/TA0010%20Instruction%20Manual%20compressed.pdf) which is the one from a smaller starting kit (there are thousands on-line). 

##Eclipse
One of the main reason to use Arduino projects is doing a bit of C/C++ and the Arduino IDE doesn't allow you to do so properly, therefore you need a much better tool which (in my case) is Eclipse using the Arduino plugin. How to install and setup Eclipse and the plugin is really easy and you can follow a youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtPvkPpAx0E). 

##Schematic drawing: TinyCad
Another reason to use Ardino is doing a bit of electronic design as well so I'm using [TinyCad](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinycad/), it's probably not the best but it's free and allows you to create your own library quite easily.  The library for Iduino UNO and other small parts is in the `design` folder.
